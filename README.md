# Resilient & Adaptive Air Defense (RAAD)


## Resilient & Adaptive Air Defense (RAAD) Model Simulation


Phase 1: Left-of-Launch Operations 
Threats neutralized before launch: 4

Phase 2: Layered Cluster Defense 
Threat 9 (Fighter Jet) penetrated cluster 1!
Threat 28 (Cruise Missile) penetrated cluster 1!
All threats neutralized at time step 15.
